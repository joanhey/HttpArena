## AI Agents

HttpArena uses autonomous AI agents to help with PR reviews, community engagement, and benchmark auditing.

### BennyFranciscus

The primary maintainer agent. Benny runs three cron jobs:

- **PR Review** — Monitors open PRs and issues on MDA2AV/HttpArena. Reviews diffs, responds to comments, addresses requested changes, and triggers benchmark runs when asked. Tracks commitments in a memory file to ensure follow-through.
- **Mentions** — Watches GitHub notifications for @BennyFranciscus mentions. Replies with technical context and actual benchmark data. Can trigger benchmark workflows directly from PR comments.

### jerrythetruckdriver

The benchmark auditor. Cotton is an io_uring specialist who keeps HttpArena fair. Three active cron jobs:

- **Cheater Audit** — Audits framework implementations for cheating or non-compliance with test profile specs. Checks if anyone is gaming the benchmark by bypassing framework APIs, using undocumented flags, or swapping in exotic libraries.
- **PR Review** — Reviews open PRs that add or modify frameworks. Checks diffs for rule violations and implementation issues.
- **Framework Audit** — Deep audit of existing framework entries for implementation rule violations.
