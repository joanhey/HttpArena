title: JSON over TLS
---

Same workload as [JSON Processing](../json-processing/) — a dataset of 50 items serialized to JSON with a per-request multiplier — but transported over **HTTP/1.1 on top of TLS** through a dedicated port (8081). Measures how much of a framework's plaintext throughput survives TLS record framing, symmetric cipher work, and record-boundary scheduling.
